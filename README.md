## Scripts

1. **Folder Tree Generator** - This script allows you to generate a folder tree structure with customizable depth and branching factor. It can be useful for creating a directory hierarchy for testing purposes or organizing files efficiently.

2. **Folder Structure Creator** - With this script, you can quickly create a predefined folder structure with multiple levels and subdirectories. It saves time by automating the manual process of creating nested folders.

3. **Web Content Downloader** - This script enables you to download content from webpages using their URLs. It supports downloading HTML pages, images, documents, and other files, making it convenient for offline access or archiving web content.

4. **Data Copy Script** - This script facilitates the copying of files and folders, including subdirectories, to a specified destination. It provides a straightforward way to duplicate data without the need for manual copying and pasting.

5. **Data Move Script** - Similar to the Data Copy Script, this script allows you to move files and folders, including their subdirectories, to a new location. It ensures that the original data is transferred accurately while preserving the directory structure.

6. **Folder Deletion Script** - Use this script to delete folders and their contents recursively. It provides a safe and efficient way to remove unwanted directories without having to delete each file or subdirectory individually.
